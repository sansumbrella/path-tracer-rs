# Path Tracer

A simple path tracer implemented in Rust following the C++ book [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://github.com/petershirley/raytracinginoneweekend). This is a learning project for both Rust and ray tracing.

Scene output (fewer pixels and more samples than the end-of-book code):

## Building and running

Run in release mode to avoid having your render take all day:
`cargo run --release`
